        <h2>Do you hazC0in??</h2>
        <p>hazC0in is more than coin, it's the coin you always need but never have……until now.<br /> 
        Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), hazC0in offers an accessible, fun, and rewarding experience for its holders while introducing innovative features like deflationary tokenomics and automatic holder rewards. Our mission is simple: Create a coin that people can trade and use but also get rewarded for holding.<br />
        hazC0in is built from the rubble of post-Helene Asheville and is determined to make sure that people have access to a currency that is always available, isn't held by the supply of ATMs, and is only regulated by its holders……</p>
        <p>….and to laugh in the face of the worst the world can throw at it!</p>
        <p>The Problem</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrency projects often fall into two extremes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Too Serious: Complex projects with minimal appeal to mainstream audiences.</li>
            <li>2. Too Flimsy: Fun memecoins with no solid foundation, leading to short-term hype and long-term disappointment.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>This gap leaves a massive opportunity: A project that delivers both entertainment and sustainable value.</p>

        <p>The Solution
        hazC0in fills the gap by:
            - Fostering Community Engagement: Our coin thrives on memes, social interaction, and creative collaboration.
            - Rewarding Loyalty: hazC0in holders automatically receive rewards simply by holding the token in their wallets.
            - Deflationary Economics: Built-in mechanisms reduce the token supply over time, driving scarcity and increasing potential value.</p>
    
        <p>hazC0in isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement that invites everyone to laugh, connect, and grow.</p>
